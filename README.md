Hud Designed By ARN Steve, Inspired by the mighty Hoj.
Aimed to be minimalistic and sleek, not interfering with gameplay, freeing up plenty of space on the screen!

The only elements that appear are the minimap and round timer, killfeed is also slightly changed to look nicer and the map loading is clean.

If you would like a more minimalist full HUD (inlcuding ammo counter/score etc) let me know in the ARN Discord.
